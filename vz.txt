The comprehensive partnership strategy is UNESCO’s overarching partnership strategy with its main partners, networks and other key stakeholders. It dates back to 20131 and the fact that it was  due  for  an  update  which  coincided  exactly  with  the  launch  of  the  strategic  transformation  represented  a  timely  opportunity  to  capture  new  thinking  on  building  a  more  open,  engaging  and  outward-looking UNESCO. 2.     The process of updating the strategy to ensure its continuing relevance has placed a premium on  stakeholder  consultation  and  ownership.  It  has  been  informed  by  the  inputs  of  the  Strategic Transformation working group on partnerships (Working Group 3), and has benefited from the active involvement  of  the  key  internal  stakeholders  including  UNESCO  staff  from  programme  sectors,  corporate  services  and  UNESCO  field  offices,  as  well  as  members  of  the  other  Strategic Transformation working groups.  3.     The strategy has also benefitted from the inputs and ideas of some of the key constituencies to  which  it  is  addressed  through  a  series  of  surveys  to  collect  the  feedback  of  the  National  Commissions  for  UNESCO,  UNESCO  city  networks  and  organizations,  networks  and  individuals,  working with the Organization, as well as UNESCO young staff members (Young UNESCO). 4.     The recommendations also draw on the audit of the External Auditor on resource mobilization2and  the  lessons  learned  from  UNESCO’s  first  structured  financing  dialogue  as  documented  in  “Structured Financing Dialogue”3 and contracted research on partnering concepts and approaches, and on private sector fundraising.5.     Most  importantly,  it  has  been  shaped  through  a  consultative  process  with  Member  States  based on the preliminary recommendations for the update of the strategy that were presented to the Executive  Board at  its  206th  session.4 In  206  EX/Decision 14,  Member  States  welcomed  the  preliminary  recommendations  and  requested  the  Director-General  to  present  the  final  updated  comprehensive partnership strategy to the Executive Board at its 207th session including proposals for different types of innovative financing mechanisms and taking into account the debate of Member States. SUMMARY 6.     Today’s global challenges are too great for any organization to tackle alone. For this reason, there is a pressing need for partnerships that bring together international organizations, networks, and  cooperation  with  the  public  and  private  sectors.  There  is  an  international  consensus  that  partnerships  with  public  and  non-public  actors  are  crucial  for  achieving  internationally  agreed Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the overall purpose of the strategy is to establish a clear framework for leveraging partnership to enhance in a consistent and strategic way the impact and visibility of UNESCO’s programme and to ensure that partnerships contribute to optimal results for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.7.     The updated comprehensive partnership strategy is firmly anchored in the 2030 Agenda and at its heart lies SDG 17, partnership for the goals. The present document constitutes (i) an update for  the  remainder  of  the  current  Medium-Term  Strategy  which  reflects  the  changing  context  for  partnership  in  which  UNESCO  operates  and  (ii)  which  paves  the  way  for  a  more  integrated,  synergistic  approach  to  partnership  for  the  2022-2029  Medium-Term  Strategy  (41 C/4).  Partners  covered by the strategy include the United Nations Development System, donors, key constituencies 1192 EX/5.INF2Audit report by External Auditor on the mobilization of extrabudgetary resources (202 EX/32.INF)3Structured Financing Dialogue Ref: 206 EX/5.II.B4Comprehensive partnership strategy, 206 EX 14 207 EX/11 – page 2 like young people, cities and business, NGOs, IGOs, and UNESCO family partners. It also defines partnerships  according  to  forms  of  engagement  and  highlights  the  role  of  UNESCO  National  Commissions in support UNESCO’s engagement with the partners at country level.  It proposes measures to create a better enabling environment for partnership at  UNESCO  and  sets  clear  principles  for  engagement  and  disengagement  and  the  proactive  management of partnerships. It includes a time-bound plan for improving the enabling environment for partnership at UNESCO, and proposes that reporting on partnerships, and on the strategy as a whole is undertaken annually as an integral part of the programme implementation report (PIR). 8. The updated strategy is given in the Annex. Proposed draft decision9.     In  light  of  the  above,  the  Executive  Board  may  wish  to  adopt  a  decision  along  the  following  lines:The Executive Board,1. Having examined document 207 EX/11,2.

Also   requests the   Director-General   to   ensure   that   the   report   on   the   updated   comprehensive partnership strategy is an integral part of the programme implementation report (PIR) submitted to the Executive Board at its 211th session;5.
